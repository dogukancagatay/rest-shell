* The RESTful shell

This is a RESTful shell that gives you command line access to a server that does not provide another means of shell access.  If you are limited to an API to interact with your server, this tool may work for you.

** Features

- Shell access to a server that does not offer shell access.
- Run commands remotely without using the system's built in authentication system.
- Not malware.  You already have permission to execute code on the server.
- Interactive shell lets you scroll through history.
- Authentication and SSL encryption.
- Readline support.

** Installation

Installation is easy with pip, but you may need some OpenSSL development header files:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install git+https://github.com/passionke/rest-shell.git
#+END_SRC

** Components

There are two components, the server and the client.

The server is written in Python using Flask and is the application that you upload to your server for execution.  Once it's running, the API will be available at the specified port.

To connect to the API you can use the client, also written in Python.  Supply the URL endpoint and you will be prompted to start entering commands.

*** Server

To start the server, use rest-shell with the server option and supply the URL for your endpoint.  You will want to set the TOKEN environment variable for authentication purposes.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
TOKEN=hackme rest-shell --server localhost:8080
#+END_SRC

*** Client

To connect to the API with the command line client, use rest-shell and supply the URL for your endpoint.  You will also need to set the TOKEN environment variable here to match the server, otherwise you won't get access.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
TOKEN=hackme rest-shell localhost:8080

** API

Currently only JSON is supported.

*** Execute command

The /execute location provides the ability to execute a command.  A sample request would look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
{
    "command": "uname -sr"
}
#+END_SRC

A sample response would look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
{
    "output": "Linux 3.10-1-amd64\n",
    "status": 0
}
#+END_SRC

Headers required are:

- Content-Type, set to "application/json"
- X-Auth-Token, set to the value for TOKEN specified on the server

With the endpoint at https://localhost:8080/execute, an example using cURL would look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -s -k -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Auth-Token: hackme' -d '{"command": "uname -sr"}' https://localhost:8080/execute
#+END_SRC

An example using HTTPie:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo '{"command": "uname -sr"}' | http --verify=no https://localhost:8080/execute X-Auth-Token:hackme
#+END_SRC

** Todo

In some order of priority:

- Ability to fork off server into background
- Add support for timing out on the server side
- Ability to change remote and local directories (with prompt updates)
- Ability ability to upload and download files in the client
- Shell completion and history commands
- Option to return stdout and stderr separately instead of combined in the server API
- Deal with stdin limitations (currently limited to shell pipelining)
